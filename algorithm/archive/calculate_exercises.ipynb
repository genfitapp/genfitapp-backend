    "\n",
    "1. When there is a large distributin remaining by the last exercise, it is assigned to that group. If we have, for example, lower back as the last exercise, the code would assigned too many exercises for that group.\n",
    "2. The number of exercises for LOWER BACK and OBLIQUES is very limited, therefore, we might need to incorporate them, along with ABS into a category called CORE. Potentially, we might have to do the same for TRAPEZIUS, by combining it with back. The problem with combining them into a single one is that, usually, it is not convenient to do, for example, lower back the day before heavy leg day. Imagine having your lower back sore, and you have to do heavy squats or deadlifts! We'll figure this out as we go."
